# OLED_patterns_FPGA
Display patterns on a 128x64 bit OLED display using a Tang Nano 9K FPGA (Gowin-GW1NR-9)
You can use the logic on any FPGA of your choice, all you need to do is configure the constraint files according to your wiring and hardware

Highlights:
1. Display updation in batches for low resource consumption
2. Use of ALU block for LUT conservation
3. Configurable framerate
4. Modular and configurable



   Below is a basic execution of a pattern:
